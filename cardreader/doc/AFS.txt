ANC File System 1

The ANC File System is dived in 3 sections:
- Header & boot
- Block info
- Directories
- Data

ALL DATA ARE BIG ENDIAN

Where:
upper dir       is the address to the upper directory (value from 1 to 96, 0 is the root directory)
Dirname         15 bytes of directory name (if the first byte is 0, there is no directory)

Data:
There are 2 major types of cluster, the file and the continuation of a file.
File:
        0        1        2        3        4        5        6        7        8        9        A        B        C        D        E        F

Where:
Filename        is the name of the file (19 bytes)
ext             is the extension (3 bytes)
next            is the block id for the continuation of the file (0 if there is no continuation)
size            is the size of the file in this cluster


Continuation of a file:
        0        1        2        3        4        5        6        7        8        9        A        B        C        D        E        F

Where:
next            is the block id for the continuation of the file (0 if there is no continuation)
size            is the size of the file in this cluster
